      <title>Won First Place at Bouldering Competition!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I won first place at 2019 Bouldering Competition held by Seoul National University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I competed with only four other participants, it was a truly exciting experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bouldering taught me how to climb, overcome, sometimes even conquer an immediate obstacle on my way. But I also learned how to rest, appreciate others&#39; amazing bouldering abilities, and enjoy little chatting with other boulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life might be like bouldering - I must believe I am brave enough to move on at the moment when I doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Got accepted to attend ABCD workshop in Portland, OR!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent an amazing week at the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development workshop held in Portland, Oregon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop focused on reproducible neuroimaing methods, predictive modeling approaches, and clincial menal health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, I had an opportunity to learn connectotyping, a novel approach to characterize resting-state functional connectivity, from Dr. Oscar Miranda-Dominguez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by this concept, I suggested an open hackathon idea and formed a group of 5 to apply connectotyping and partial least squares regression (PLSR) to the ABCD and ABIDE data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fit the connectotyping data to PLSR to predict fluid intelligence scores in a data-driven approach. Interestingly, the preliminary result showed that the connectotyping data with the somatosensory cortex performed better than the null data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were not testing any specific hypotheses, the project had not been developed further. However, I still learned so much from this opportunity! Hope I can attend the next one soon :)&lt;/p&gt;
