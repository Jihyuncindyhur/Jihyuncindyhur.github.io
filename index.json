Functional magnetic resonance imag- ing (fMRI) is the most popular and widely used neuroimaging technique, and there is growing interest in fMRI-based markers of individual differences. How- ever, its utility is often limited due to its high cost and difficulty acquiring from specific populations, including children and infants. Surrogate markers, or neu- ral correlates of fMRI markers, would have important practical implications, but we have few stand-alone predictors for the fMRI markers. Here, using machine learning (ML) models and data augmentation, we predicted well-validated fMRI markers of human cognition from multivariate patterns of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a portable and relatively inexpensive optical neuroimaging technique. We recruited 50 human participants who performed two cognitive tasks (stop signal task and probabilistic reversal learning task), while neural activation was measured with either fNIRS or fMRI at each of the total two visits. Using ML models and data augmentation, we could predict the well-established fMRI markers of response inhibition or prediction error signals from 48-channel fNIRS activation in the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that fNIRS might offer a surrogate marker of fMRI activation, which would broaden our understanding of various populations, including infants.","tags":["fMRI","fNIRS","Machine Learning","Data Augmentation"],"title":"Mapping fNIRS to fMRI with Neural Data Augmentation Machine Learning Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604448000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604448000,"objectID":"ed897f325f5cfaf6a01aa0437bbc85c6","permalink":"https://Jihyuncindyhur.github.io/event/2020-1104-nair-2020/","publishdate":"2021-01-12T01:54:37+09:00","relpermalink":"/event/2020-1104-nair-2020/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Psychotherapy and Computational Psychiatry","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587575141,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587575141,"objectID":"10b6e89a1db2187b5847bd37da404aa4","permalink":"https://Jihyuncindyhur.github.io/event/2020-0423-westbrook-2020/","publishdate":"2021-01-12T02:05:41+09:00","relpermalink":"/event/2020-0423-westbrook-2020/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Psychostimulant and Cognitive Control","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586711390,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586711390,"objectID":"c3cba5ccb177b0a646c35afe922a6a67","permalink":"https://Jihyuncindyhur.github.io/event/2020-0413-delgado-2008/","publishdate":"2021-01-12T02:09:50+09:00","relpermalink":"/event/2020-0413-delgado-2008/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Regulation of Fear","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jihyun Hur"],"categories":["Climbing","Sport","Bouldering"],"content":"I won first place at 2019 Bouldering Competition held by Seoul National University.\nEven though I competed with only four other participants, it was a truly exciting experience!\nBouldering taught me how to climb, overcome, sometimes even conquer an immediate obstacle on my way.

Interestingly, the preliminary result showed that the connectotyping data with the somatosensory cortex performed better than the null data.\nAs we were not testing any specific hypotheses, the project had not been developed further. However, I still learned so much from this opportunity!
